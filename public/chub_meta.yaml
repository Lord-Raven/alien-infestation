creator_notes: "This stage adds an escalating alien infestation scenario over top of whatever mundane chat you have going on.<br>
<br>
Whether you're [trapped aboard a doomed space freighter](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/adeline-larue-07a7a611) 
or just [spending a quiet evening in with the nanny](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/bridget-f3fa710f), 
an alien attack can come at any moment--just add this stage to your chat and watch things take an unsettling turn for the worse.<br>
<br>
**Configuration!**<br>
* Pacing: controls the rate of escalation in the scenario; things start off kind of eerie and become increasingly dangerous as the alien becomes more powerful.<br>
* Sexual gratuity level: the scenario tends to be a little sexy by default, but can be cleaner or (much) more screwed up, if you so desire.<br>
* Violence gratuity level: action will be a bit violent by default, but can be adjusted up or down.<br>
Of course, this content is also influenced by the bot and other elements sent to the LLM, so these settings are just prominent nudges in one direction or the other.<br>
<br>
**Next Up**<br>
It's still a bit work-in-progress, so you may see some debug output in the console, but the core concept is functional.
Essentially, the longer the chat goes on (from the point where the stage was added), the more dire the alien situation becomes. 
I'd like to make the escalation a bit more intelligent, potentially assessing the scope of time a response represents, 
so waiting around advances the alien's evolution more quickly than having a conversation; I have an idea of how to achieve this, but it's still in-progress. 
I'm also working on adding at least a couple of additional alien scenarios, 
to be randomly selected per-chat (or deliberately selected through the settings), to increase replayability a bit.
