                "5": "The alien is a small tentacular parasite, roughly one foot in total length. It is weak but quick, rapidly seeking a host to attach to. They can render their host unknowing and influence them to make poor or malevolent choices--often sexual in nature.",
                "20": "The alien is a small mass of squirming tentacles--roughly one yard in radius. It is evasive and fully controls anyone it attaches to, driving them to commit acts of sexual or physical aggression.",
                "40": "The alien is flailing, deadly mass of writhing tentacular limbs--roughly the size of an adult. It's mere presence inspires horrifying acts of sex or violence."
