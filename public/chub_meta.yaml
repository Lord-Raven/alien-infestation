creator_notes: "This stage introduces an evolving alien infestation scenario on top of any chat, transforming even the most mundane slice-of-life roleplay into a horrific life-or-death crisis.<br>
<br>
Whether you're [trapped aboard a doomed space freighter](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/adeline-larue-07a7a611) 
or just [spending a quiet evening in with the nanny](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/bridget-f3fa710f), 
an alien attack can come at any moment--just add this stage to your chat and watch things take an unsettling turn for the worse.<br>
<br>
**What It Does**<br>
The stage provides escalating instructions to the bot, evoking an eerie atmosphere as it slowly introduces a random, growing alien menace to the narrative. 
The longer the chat goes on, the more dangerous the alien becomes. Works great as end-game revitalization for a chat you're tiring of!<br>
<br>
It's actually a very simple concept, but this kind of slow-burn, measured escalation is something I've found LLMs handle very poorly without a lot of babysitting. 
This extension is basically a babysitter that feeds gradually more dire instructions to the bot.<br>
<br>
The stage adds approximately 150-200 tokens per request. It's still a little work-in-progress; if you don't mind spoilers, you can see the prompt additions in your browser console, 
and you may notice other debug output, as well. If you see errors or have comments, please let me know in the discussion :).<br>
<br>
**Configuration!**<br>
You can tweak a few of the stage's behaviors:<br>
* Alien: random by default, you can select a particular alien archetype to play with--or be surprised.<br>
* Pacing: sets the rate of escalation in the scenario, so you can slow the burn or get to the action more quickly.<br>
* Sexual gratuity: the scenario tends to be a little scintilating by default, but can be cleaner or (much) more screwed up, if you so desire.<br>
* Violence gratuity: action will be a bit violent by default, but can be adjusted up or down.<br>
Of course, this content is also influenced by the bot and other elements sent to the LLM, so these settings are just prominent nudges in one direction or the other.<br>
<br>
**Next Up**<br>
I'd like to make the rate of escalation a bit more intelligent, potentially assessing the scope of time a response represents, 
so waiting around advances the alien's evolution more quickly than having a conversation; I have some ideas on how to achieve this, but it's still in-progress. 
I'm also working on add some more alien scenarios.
