creator_notes: "This stage adds an escalating alien infestation scenario over top of whatever mundane chat you have going on.<br>
<br>
[Chatting with a bot on a doomed freighter?](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/adeline-larue-07a7a611) Obviously.<br>
[On a mission for a clandestine organization?](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/catalina-viper-torres-02120dfa0928) Of course.<br>
[Spending a quiet evening in with the nanny?](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/bridget-f3fa710f) Why not?<br>
[Just discovered the Underdark and it's already a whole *thing*?](https://venus.chub.ai/characters/Ravenok/vezverel-9ded8b95) Go wild.<br>
<br>
# Configuration!<br>
- Alien Archetype: there are a couple of different aliens with different behaviors; one is randomly chosen per chat by default, but you can choose a specific one or swap it around (could get weird mid-chat).<br>
- Pacing: controls the rate of escalation in the scenario; things start off kind of eerie and become increasingly dangerous as the alien becomes more powerful.<br>
- Sexual gratuity level: set to taste. Things will tend to get a little sexy by default, but could be cleaner or more screwed up if you so choose.<br>
- Violence gratuity level: set to taste. Action will be a bit violent by default, but can be adjusted up or down."

# 'NONE' will not display, only run.
# 'COVER' will, indeed, cover the chat history completely,

# 'FULLSCREEN' will make nothing below the header bar
#   show except for your stage.
