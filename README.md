# Overview
This is a very simple stage that uses an escalation stat to gradually ramp up alien infestation verbiage that is appended to your prompts. With each response, the escalation stat is incremented by an amount determined by the pacing configuration setting. The verbiage send to the LLM varies by the selected alien scenario as well as the content gratuity settings.

Documentation is pretty bare, and there is a lot of template residue present; I have chosen to make the repository public so others can see what's going on in here.
